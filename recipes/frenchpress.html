        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This quick article will explain how to make a proper cup of coffee. No kcups and absolutely no pre-ground coffee allowed. 
            We will start from fresh whole beans and grind them to a consistency slighlty larger than the openings of the press filter screen. 
            Using a hand grinder, such as the LIDO-ET grinder, we can tune the grind setting perfectly for the french press. Why settle for less when you can have the best? 
            Follow this guide, and you'll be on your way to making the best coffee that you've ever had the honor of tasting.
